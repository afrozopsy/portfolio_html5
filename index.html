									An avid Gamer, Thinker and Computer Programmer.
									I am a Full-Stack applications developer, with expertise in MERN stack.
									Been coding since 2015, started off with Java and C++. And quickly shifted to web technologies like Node.js and React in 2017.
									Then I started my mobile development journey with React-Native because of my familiarity with React in 2019.
									In 2020, I shifted over to Flutter because of the strongly typed nature of Dart and the awesomeness that comes with it. As of
									2022, I develop full-stack mobile and web apps.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have a Graduate Degree in Mechatronics Engg. from University of Engineering and Technology Lahore.
									In my graduate program I enrolled in courses like Intelligent systems, Embedded System and Robotics.
									All of these were very interesting to me. But embedded systems was of particular interest to me. I loved
									it. The fact that there are tiny 5$ computer chips out there that we can connect to our massive
									backend systems. May be add AI to whole platform and create awesome projects out of it. Since then
									C has been my favorite programming language, beacuse of the shear power developers can harness out of
									it.

									oKoro
								</h1>
								<p>
									oKoro is a image editing app build using React-Native. You can apply filters and control the intensity of it. And export the edited image in your gallery.
									Technical Details: This project was made in React-Native. I used EXPO SDK for a lot of their tools. And react-gl was used to do the heavy lifting and actually blending the GLSL fragment shaders with the input image. It was a nice experience to see web technologies working right way in mobile with power of react-native.
									<br />
									Side Node: This project was made in March 2020. And it does requires a update as the GLSurface doesn't work on some cellphones. But anyways, It does work in my phone and may be it will on yours as well.
									Here is the link to download it.
